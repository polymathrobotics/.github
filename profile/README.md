## We're Polymath Robotics!  ðŸ¤–

We're empowering robotics teams to get stuff working in the field, faster. Effortlessly add autonomy
to any industrial vehicle, so you can focus on what makes your customers tick.

If you're new, check out podcast, "[Automate It](https://open.spotify.com/show/1lL9aEPOSYzajj21NMV9oG)",
where our co-founders Stefan and Ilia share robotics war stories, weird facts, and little-known approaches
to building robots that actually work. Also check out our [public API](https://github.com/polymathrobotics/caladan_examples).
